[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/u1n232pi38573jgq/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/wmeints/neuromatic/branch/master)

This library is a neural network abstraction for C# inspired by Keras. This project aims to make the use of CNTK and Tensorflow
more straightforward from a C# developer perspective. It provides an easy to use abstraction so that you can experiment
quicker and get your models in production quicker.

**NOTICE** This might not be the repository you're looking for. Recently, I've been contacted that people were finding this repository instead of the intended repository containing Neuromatic which is used for neuroscience. If you're working in the field of neuroscience, be sure to check out the other [Neuromatic repository](https://github.com/SilverLabUCL/NeuroMatic)
